          <h1>Welcome to my Blog</h1>

          <p class="blog-names">Grammar Schmammer</p>
          <p>We all remember sitting in school learning about such popular topics as appositive phrases, intransitive verbs, coordinating conjunctions, subordinate clauses, and a whole assortment of other colorful terms used to describe the intricacies of English grammar. Or do we? A lot of people seem to block out those important classes from their memory, and some even proclaim a vehement hatred of grammar.</p>

          <details>
            <summary class="blog-switch">Continue Reading...</summary>

            <p>How can this be true? Well, some people find grammar to be overly restrictive, too inflexible, or just downright annoying. So, just how essential is grammar to a language? Like the majority of life’s most interesting questions, it all depends on who you ask. </p>

            <p>If you happen to ask me, I would agree with Benjamin Dreyer when he argues that the most important job of grammar is to bolster clarity. Grammar has the remarkable ability of removing ambiguity from sentences, the caveat being if it’s used correctly, of course!  With all its powers, grammar cannot eliminate ambiguity entirely, however. And even it could, there is still the chance that different people would construe the same sentences differently. If you want to get philosophical here, technically that already happens with every single sentence, because everyone has a different idea of what every word means to them. As the bard famously quipped, “A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” I guess the goal, then, would be to ensure that the most number of people understand your sentence in the same way that you do; in other words, how you intended it to be received.</p>

            <p>I’d like to recount a fun little illustration of this notion from my college days. One night, one of my housemates came to me with a simple request. Pointing to a book, he said, “I have to run, so when you get a chance, please put that book on the couch in my room.” I hesitated for a second and thought to myself, <q>When did you get a couch in your room?</q>  Really he meant, <q>Put the book that is located on the couch into my room.</q> But I interpreted it as, <q>Put the book that I am currently pointing to on the couch that is in my room.</q>
              (Even if he did have a couch in his room, I would have thought that to be a rather oddly specific request.) The meaning was not entirely clear due to his construction of the prepositional phrases. From the way that he phrased his request, both interpretations are equally plausible, but he had a different intended meaning in mind than the one that I received. I guess technically that is more a syntax issue, but syntax can still be considered a part of grammar. If you want to geek out, take a look at this <a class= "blog-link" href= "https://essentialsoflinguistics.pressbooks.com/chapter/9-2-ambiguity/" target= "_blank">educational excerpt</a> that demonstrates this effect of syntactic ambiguity far more eloquently and with diagrams. </p>


            <p>On the other side of the grammar debate was one of my classmates in a fiction writing course from college. Strangely enough, she denounced grammar as an elitist concept, one that should be forsaken altogether. She argued for a more egalitarian approach to language, which I guess translates to no rules at all. While I could understand where she was coming from, I really didn’t agree with her thought process. I can admit that I am saying that from a privileged perspective of having received a very rigorous education (which included a hefty amount of grammatical study), but without grammar, things can get a little messy.  </p>

            <div class="blog-image-div">

            <img class="blog-image" src="images/blog-01/stressed-teacher.jpeg" alt="stressed teacher" width="450" title="stressed teacher">

            <p class="caption">I mean how annoying would it be right if you had to read a sentence without using any punctuation or appropriate grammar it would just keep going on and on and before you know it you have like twenty sentence fragments and run on sentences that just keep going on and on not to mention all of the linguistic ambiguities that would result I mean the horror it really gives you a newfound appreciation of grammar doesn’t it I mean I surely think that it does what about you kids dont try this at home some assembly required get your parents permission before calling non-attorney spokesperson </p>

            </div>

            <p>Despite grammar’s essential functions, people still stubbornly refuse to like it. Most people detest the dissection of grammar, even though somehow they sort of inherently or subconsciously grasp and follow its principles, a miraculous process similar to the almost magical phenomenon of speech acquisition, which I happen to find downright incredible. I actually have always secretly enjoyed grammar, despite the grumblings of my childhood classmates.  “How could I?” they questioned.  Because! Grammar saves lives! I’m sure you’ve all heard the daring tales of the heroic vocative comma valiantly saving grandmothers everywhere: It’s the difference between “Let’s eat, grandma” and “Let’s eat grandma.” Okay, you got me; technically “because” is not a sentence on its own, but I used it for dramatic effect, so it’s okay, right? I’ll call it a rhetorical device. </p>

            <p>I can’t quite put my finger on it, but there’s something amazing about having an almost mathematical/formulaic quality to something like a language that essentially allows for an infinite arrangement of its component parts (i.e. words and sentences). Of course, there are exceptions, as any linguist would tell you, like paradigms and syntagms; for example, you can say “a dog” or “his dog,” but not “a his dog.” I mean, I guess you could say it if you really wanted to, but you probably would cause some serious confusion. </p>

            <p>Speaking of infinite arrangement, have you ever heard about the <a class= "blog-link" href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem#:~:text=The%20infinite%20monkey%20theorem%20states,an%20infinite%20number%20of%20times" target= "_blank">infinite monkey theorem</a>? Basically, it’s the thought experiment that says that if you had a hypothetical library of limitless size and in it were books made entirely from randomly generated letters (perhaps produced by an infinite number of determined moneys on typewriters), you would have in it every single book ever written and every future book yet to be written. How cool is that? Or perhaps uncool, because this thought experiment really undermines the work of the best authors. </p>

            <div class="blog-image-div">

            <img class="blog-image" src="images/blog-01/monkey-type.jpeg" alt="monkey on a typewriter" width="450" title="monkey on a typewriter">

            <p class="caption">Don’t mind me; just randomly writing here. Hey! My title actually makes sense: On the Origin of Species. Hmm…</p>

            </div>

            <p>It is conceivable that the vast majority of the output of these monkeys would be unintelligible gibberish with wildly inconsistent grammatical rules, but every so often a Pulitzer winner could materialize. That brings me to another reason that I tend to like and appreciate grammar: It’s sort of comforting to adhere to its rules, otherwise learning English—or really any language for that matter—would be even more of a mammoth task. Can you imagine trying to learn a language where anything goes?</p>

            <p>If something is not done to intervene, we could be headed in that direction. Unfortunately, I have noticed that there seems to be grammatical deterioration of sorts going on, especially as people get more and more lazy when it comes to communicating virtually. (I cringe a little to think that some people consider “R u ok” to be a full and complete sentence…) Even though some people are more talented than others at switching between their professional and causal parlance, many are not, and the casual parlance seems to insidiously grow. My personal opinion: That is a slippery slope to go down. Hopefully something can be done about this, but who knows? Maybe grammar could somehow be taught in a more fun manner in school. That way people wouldn’t shy away from it as much.  </p>

            </div>

            <p>In conclusion, while grammar may not be everyone’s cup of tea, I hope that this small exploration of it has made you reconsider its usefulness. I don’t pretend to be an infallible grammarian (I have been known to misplace my commas from time to time), but I do try to follow the rules the best I can. I think it’s something worthy of mastery. Do you? </p>

          <p class="blog-names">To Adapt Language or Not to Adapt Language: That is the Question</p>
          <p>Did you ever notice how Shakespeare’s English sounds a bit different from modern English? (Not the band, but the statement holds either way.) Okay, that was an understatement.  It’s pretty hard to miss that.  And if you don’t notice any difference, kudos to you!  You are most definitely a genius and/or a reincarnated bard. </p>

          <details>

            <summary class="blog-switch">Continue Reading...</summary>

            <p>There are countless reasons why this is the case, but they all boil down to the fact that languages are dynamic; they live and breathe through their carriers, i.e. human begins, who constantly reshape it by coining new words (neologisms = neo meaning “new,” and logos meaning “word”), redefining or adding definitions to current words (the bread and butter of usage commentators; I’ve often wondered how one exactly becomes a usage commentator), or by throwing out words that have fallen out of fashion for one reason or another (archaic diction).  When’s the last time you were called a strumpet?  For the record, a Ren Faire doesn’t count.  I happen to like the sound of that word, but it isn’t exactly a compliment.   </p>

            <p>Ever since I read the book Frindle when I was in elementary school, I became intrigued by this idea of altering language.  The story is about Nick, an admittedly mischievous child who prevails in spreading the newly defined “frindle” across the nation, ultimately landing an entry in the dictionary.  The book demonstrates that anyone can impact an entire language.  Of course, it’s a fictional story, but it can happen.  It certainly did with Shakespeare.  He is credited with inventing more English words than any other person.  How does this occur?  I guess it’s a secret formula of creativity and influence, one that has been catalyzed by the advent of social media.  And with the oftentimes anonymity of social media, the actual author of a new word can be unclear, clouded by its massive spread.  It’s rather odd, this phenomenon of accepting a new word or a new definition of a word.  On the one hand, it’s a somewhat democratic process, with the majority of people either accepting or rejecting it.  On the other, it can seem as if the new word or definition takes on a spirit of its own, and people can’t do a thing to prevent its propagation.
            </p>




















            <p>Interestingly, I recently read about the Académie Française in France, which keeps a close eye on the evolution and maintenance of the French language.  They are strict and stubborn, not allowing the pure French language to be corrupted nearly as much as the English language (I use the meaning of “corruption” in its word-altering sense, not in its political sense).  Truth be told, though, they really should think about updating their number system; it’s incredibly convoluted.  If you’ve never seen it before, <a class= "blog-link" href= "https://www.thelocal.fr/20190320/so-how-did-the-french-end-up-with-their-crazy-numbers" target= "_blank">read this</a>, and you’ll understand what I’m talking about.  I feel bad for little French children trying to do arithmetic!  Anyway, it is for this reason that modern-day French speakers can better understand their classic authors than English speakers can understand Shakespeare and his contemporaries.  Which brings me to the question I’ve been meaning to ask for this entire blog post: Is this good or bad?
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>Of course, there is not a correct answer to this question.  It’s merely a thought experiment; food for thought (another idiom!), as they say.  Some would argue that intuitively understanding historic language is a gift, as many who have struggled to comprehend Shakespeare would tell you.  But in my opinion, the chasm between modern English and Shakespearean English is precisely what makes it charming and beautiful.  Yes, it can be difficult to understand, especially at first, but with time and experience comes greater Shakespearean literacy.  It’s a healthy challenge; one that can lead to an improved grasp of modern English, too.  I am grateful for my middle school for running a Renaissance unit—a delightful couple of weeks where every class taught something prevalent during the Renaissance—which culminated in our grade putting on versions of some of his plays.  (I delivered my two lines as a servant impeccably, if I do say so myself).
            </p>

            <p>So French speakers, through no fault of their own, may be robbed of the opportunity to grow in this particular way from reading the seminal works of their most celebrated authors.  Granted, I cannot speak to this effect, because in theory it can be applied only to your mother tongue.  But it’s nevertheless interesting to ponder.
            </p>

            <img class="blog-image" src="images/blog-02/marty.jpeg" alt="marty and doc" width="450" title="marty and doc">

            <p class="caption">“Woah, Doc, that‘s heavy.”  “Weight has nothing to do with it!”  This classic exchange between Marty and Doc illustrates a new meaning of a word in a different time period.  Perhaps if Marty and Doc were French, this joke would have no meaning. Sorry to bring this pair back into the blog again, but I couldn’t help it; it seemed appropriate.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>A follow-up question: does this restrictiveness promote or inhibit creativity?  Once again, it depends on how you look at it.  I would argue that the rules of, say, a sonnet, with its 14 lines and rhyme scheme, promote creativity because they require you to work within the confines of their specific parameters to get your point across.  That, to me, embodies more creativity than writing prose, which permits almost anything, provided you follow the rules of grammar.  (Grammar is another essential component of language that tends to develop over time, but that’s a discussion for a future blog post).  The two serve their unique purposes, and in my opinion, contribute to the remarkable versatility of languages (imagine trying to write a business proposal in a series of sonnets or limericks.  While they would certainly be more fun to read than an insipid business proposal, I can’t help but think that your clients would not take you seriously).  Conversely, others might say that the absence of rules provides fertile ground for creativity.  That may be true, too, but I think that having some rules and/or guidelines to follow in any creative endeavor encourages a richer type of creativity than an “anything goes” approach.  Further, I’d argue that it mirrors the quote unquote “real world” better.

            <p>It appears that this blog post has become more of an essay than a blog post.  You’re welcome.  So, in conclusion, while there may not be correct answers to the questions that I posed, wouldn’t you agree that they are compelling ideas to consider?  Of course, it would be impudent to claim the superiority of one language over the other, but I think something of value can be gained from comparing and contrasting the differing processes and principles that make up every language.

          <p class="blog-names">Blog Topic Shift Alert: A Departure from Mass Communication (Well, Sort of)</p>

          <p>As 2020 (finally) came to a close, so, too, did my Mass Communication Theory course at UF.  This course was the impetus for this very blog.  I am very grateful that my professor, Dr. Evans, decided to assign us a blog for the semester.  For a while, I had wanted to write a blog, but I had no idea what I wanted the topic of it to be. </p>

          <details>

            <summary class="blog-switch">Continue Reading...</summary>

            <p>Mass Communication solved that problem for me in a jiffy.</p>

            <div class="blog-image-div">

            <img class="blog-image" src="images/blog-03/marty.jpeg" alt="marty and doc" width="450" title="marty and doc">

            <p class="caption">"Whatever you do, Marty, don't go to 2020!" I think we all can agree with Doc on this one. Even though the year was almost entirely terrible, I am thankful that I completed most of my graduate degree during quarantine.</p>

            </div>

            <p>But as the end of the semester inched closer and closer, I found myself toying with the idea of continuing it in some capacity.  I had to admit, the weekly blog posts were almost therapeutic in a sense—akin to a diary entry—and an intellectual workout in another.  But, of course, the dreaded question returned: what should the topic be?  I thought long and hard about it, and I believe I came to the perfect conclusion.  It will be a blog of words!  Well, duh; it is a blog, after all. To clarify, I mean it will be a blog dedicated entirely to words.  I intend to discuss the derivations of words, i.e. their etymologies, a topic that I have long been fascinated by since high school.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure other random topics will pop up from time to time, but the central thread tying everything together will be word origins and usage.
            </p>

            <div class="blog-image-div">

            <img class="blog-image" src="images/blog-03/nerd.jpeg" alt="nerd pointing excitedly" width="450" title="nerd pointing excitedly">

            <p class="caption">Does it get any nerdier than a blog decided to etymology? Quite possibly not, I’ll admit.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>I was incredibly satisfied when that idea hit me, because the possibilities are essentially limitless.  The domain of words stretches almost infinitely, and touches almost every field, ideal for a blog that doesn’t want to pigeonhole itself into one theme until the source of ideas dries up.  Expect some philosophical musings to manifest themselves, too, along the way.  Speaking of philosophical musings, did you ever pause to consider the fact that words can only be defined by other words?  Wouldn’t that then render all words to be meaningless?  I remember the first time I thought about that, I was blown away.  There has to be some sort of foundation, then, on which to build language.  Now, I can’t pretend to be any sort of expert on linguistics (even though I did take Spanish Linguistics in college, thank you very much) but I have to think that language evolved from concrete parts of speech first, which then morphed into abstract ones by way of extension (aka metaphors), which has to do with the carrying of meaning.  Of course, this is mostly conjecture, because it would be impossible to examine a developing language from the inside out to test this hypothesis and see these changes happening in real time, because you would need language to report and observe such findings.
            </p>

            <p>There have been studies devoted to this idea; <a class= "blog-link" href= "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0137" target= "_blank">this is one of them</a>.  (In the spirit of bridging the gap between my previous blog postings and those of the new theme, I decided to include a link to an academic article to support my supposition.)
            </p>

            <p>This brings us to our very first etymology discussion; try to contain your excitement 😊 The word this time is: metaphor, which comes to us via Late Latin and Greek metaphora, meaning “a transfer,” especially regarding the use of one word in a different sense, literally “a carrying over.”  To go back further, it’s a combination of Greek meta, meaning “over or across,” and pherein, meaning “to carry,” or “to bear.”  Thank you to <a class= "blog-link" href= "https://www.etymonline.com/word/metaphor#etymonline_v_14710" target= "_blank">etymonline</a> for this history lesson; I have a feeling I will be consulting them frequently.  I bet you can think of a plethora of meta cousins; off the top of my head, I’ve come up with metadata, metamorphosis, and just plain meta, which has become a word in its own right, an adjective applied to something being cognizant of and commenting on itself.  For pherein, I thought I was being clever by assuming that this word was a distant relative to word freight, but it turns out I was mistaken; apparently, that
            <a class= "blog-link" href= "https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=freight" target= "_blank">word</a> actually has a Dutch/German history to it.
            </p>

            <p>Sorry, a bit of a tangent, I know, but those are to be expected in this blog.  So, it is with newfound determination—due in part to the new year and due in part to my recent viewing of Julie & Julia—that I endeavor to continue my blog, albeit with a slightly modified topic.  (Unlike Julie Powell, however, I do not plan on blogging every day, but I will do my best to adhere to the once a week precedent set by my course.)  The beauty of talking about words, though, is that technically it fits nicely into a Mass Communication blog, but I guess it’s a broader topic.  Or, maybe it’s a more specific topic?  I’ll have to get back to you on that one.

            <p>Further justification for the blog’s continuation: to prove to myself that the perfect time to do something does not exist.  I’ve always felt that when the time was right, I’d start a blog, or when I felt like it, I’d start a blog.  But honestly, that time never came, until I was forced to start one because of graduate school.  In fact, I’d argue that what feels to be the wrong time is actually the perfect (or, at least, the closest to perfect that you can get) time to begin the end of your procrastination.  That’s just my two cents, though, so take it with a grain of salt.  (Hey, look, my first idioms!  I plan on speaking about those at length in a future blog post, so until then, stayed tuned.)

          <p>For the blog post this time, I was tasked with coming up a specific challenge facing the mass communication industry, and exploring how mass communication theory can be used to help mitigate/remedy it.  At first, I had some difficulty coming up with a problem to speak about, but after some careful deliberation, I thought about the proliferation of fake news.  </p>

            <p>Fake news has become an increasingly insidious problem, primarily through social media accounts.  According to <a class= "blog-link" href= "https://www.statista.com/statistics/657111/fake-news-sharing-online/" target= "_blank">Statista.com</a>, it is estimated that 49% of people unknowingly shared news online which they later found out was false, and perhaps more concerningly, 10% of respondents actually admitted to knowingly sharing false information on their social media accounts.  (This <a class= "blog-link" href= "https://www.statista.com/topics/3251/fake-news/" target= "_blank">page</a> contains oodles of studies having to do with fake news; check it out).
            </p>

            <p>Mass communication theory can indeed be helpful when it comes to identifying and responding to fake news.  There are several theories that we have discussed in the course that are applicable to this phenomenon, namely, the hypodermic needle/magic bullet theory, the two-step flow theory, the elaboration likelihood model, and the agenda-setting theory.  I believe that the mere act of studying these theories and being cognizant of their effects (regardless of whether or not you believe in them wholeheartedly) can render you impervious to fake news, or at least less susceptible to it.  I will now go through each of these theories, in turn, and describe how they relate to fake news.
            </p>

            <p>Even though the hypodermic needle/magic bullet theory is generally considered to be outdated and not entirely accurate, it can be argued that some people who take in fake news and respond to it passively like a drug, not questioning it whatsoever, are falling victim to the effects of this theory.
            </p>

            <p>The two-step flow theory certainly applies to fake news.  The theory claims that people depend on trusted information gatherers to interpret and redeliver the news to them; the only problem is, these intermediaries may construe the news in one way, but the source meant it in another.  Because of this disconnect, fake news can result, either on purpose or unintentionally.
            </p>

            <p>The elaboration likelihood model applies to fake news, too.  People knowingly spreading fake news rely upon the peripheral routes of receivers of that news to process the information.  When the peripheral route is engaged, people don’t focus on the content of the message as much as they do to superficial factors, such as the source’s appearance, their perception and feelings about the source, and the kind of mood that the receiver of the message is in at the time of the message’s delivery.  If people understand this idea, they can do their best to activate their central routes of information processing and take a more skeptical approach to the information being received.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, the agenda-setting theory applies to fake news, more so to those purposefully spreading fake news as opposed to those doing so by accident.  The agenda-setting theory claims that news organizations act as gatekeepers, allowing information that they deem newsworthy to pass through the gate and blocking other stories deemed less so.  Clearly, someone maliciously propagating false information has an agenda they are trying to further by allowing false information to pass through the figurative gate.
            </p>

            <p>Thankfully, several organizations/procedures have emerged to help the average person sort fact from fiction.  <a class= "blog-link" href= "http://snopes.com/" target= "_blank">Snopes.com</a> is a popular fact-checking website, and <a class= "blog-link" href= "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/twitters-fact-checking-labels/story?id=70903715" target= "_blank">Twitter</a> even has a new built-in fact checking service that started as a result of Covid-19 misinformation, but has since branched out to other fields like politics.

            <p>Unfortunately, it seems likely that fake news will continue to be circulated on the web.  But with a little help from mass communication theory, people can be better prepared to spot it when they see it.  Additionally, fully understanding the implications of these theories can ideally prevent that 10% of people who knowingly spread false information from doing so.  Hope you enjoyed the post!
