          <p>I’m a content creator with a passion for words and media, especially when combined to produce something truly remarkable. On this website, you can take a glimpse into my academic and professional worlds. As a fervent logophile, I’ve always been fascinated by the ability of words to transfix, transform, and transmit emotion to their recipients. It is my hope that you experience these verbs while looking around.</p>

          <br>

          <p>At Emory University, I earned my bachelor’s degree in English and Creative Writing, studying the greatest wordsmiths of all. While I was there, I also developed an interest in psychology, where I learned about scientific ideas that further improved my storytelling skills. Psychology naturally led to advertising and marketing, disciplines in which I can apply and utilize all of the information I have gathered over the years.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Now, as a graduate student at the University of Florida pursuing a degree in Mass Communication with a specialization in Digital Strategy, I am confident that I can employ words to help companies exceed their goals, solve problems, and hopefully, initiate positive change in the world.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Please feel free to look around so that instead of me merely telling you about my work and background, you can experience it for yourself.</p>
